# CSED273 Final Project
#### Implementing CORDIC Algorithm to calculate sine and cosine
---
## Progress
- [x] Implement basic operations ( <<, x10, +(-), &)

- [x] Implement testbench for basic operations

- [x] Implement CORDIC algorithm to `cordic.v` file

- [x] Implement testbench of CORDIC algorithm

- [x] FPGA test

- [ ] Apply sequential logics (@ least 6 states)

## Others
* (Jun 01) Multiplication algorithm debugged.
* (Jun 02) FPGA board test done.
    * with TA's reference code for constraints.

## Todo
* ~~Debug Multiplier as 32bit multipliers with given format :~~
    * Issue Fixed: Addition carry propagate direction.
