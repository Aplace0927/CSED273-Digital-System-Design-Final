# CSED273 Final Project

### Implementing CORDIC Algorithm to calculate sine and cosine

---

## Progress

- [x] Implement basic operations ( <<, x10, +(-), &)

- [x] Implement testbench for basic operations

- [x] Implement CORDIC algorithm to `cordic.v` file

- [x] Implement testbench of CORDIC algorithm

- [x] FPGA test

- [X] Apply sequential logics (@ least 6 states)

## Others

- (Jun 01) Multiplication algorithm debugged.

- (Jun 02) FPGA board test done.

  - with TA's reference code for constraints.

- (Jun 10) FPGA Test w/ Sequential logic done.
  - Now we can watch each steps of CORDIC algorithm (as a state).

## Todo

- ~~Debug Multiplier as 32bit multipliers with given format :~~
  - Issue Fixed: Addition carry propagate direction.
